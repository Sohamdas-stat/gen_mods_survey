The file `env.yml` contains a specification for a conda environment. The environment can be created by running `make_env.sh`, which both creates the environment and creates a Jupyter kernel based on it. Note that if the environment activation, kernel creation, or environment deactivation lines in the script cause errors, it may work to run them directly on the command line.
